Example SJ-1 ** SSRZ via PPP-RTK-AdV via Channel 5C by Stefan Juhl

Example is based on the code of example 5 of Jvan Katwijk DAB software.
It is a simple command line tool.
It's purpose is to receive satellite correction data which is broadcasted via
5C band in germany.

--- Relevant stuff, that needs to be updated ---
bytesOut is a new callback function, a function that is called
from the tdc handler (and later may be from others as well)

The data parameter is a packet with a 4 byte header
byte 0 is 0xFF
byte 1 is 0x00
byte 2 is 0xFF
byte 3 is 0x00
byte 4 is the high byte of the 16 bit size
byte 5 is the low  byte of the 16 bit size
byte 6 is 0x00
byte 7 is 0 for packet type 0, 0xFF for packet type 1

Note that the lenngth is the length of the data part, so not taking the
header into account

The bytesOut function puts the data into a simple TCP server that can be 
read from port 8888 (depending on the configuration).
